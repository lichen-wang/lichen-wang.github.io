Welcome!
======

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia.

**Research Fields**: Labor Economics, Applied Microeconomics. Econometrics

In my dessertation, I apply a wide range of empirical methods to understand the supply side response to demand shocks in the local labor markets. I also have keen interests in the application of new methods that combine causal inferences + machine learning on real-world business questions.
