Welcome!
======

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Virginia.

**Research Fields**: Labor Economics, Applied Microeconomics. Econometrics

My PhD dissertation covers topics on local market dynamics and individual responses to government policies. I apply econometric techniques to address endogeneity and estimate the causal impact. I also have keen interests in state-of-the-art models that combines causal inferences + machine learning. During my recent internship at Amazon, I studied the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) of a targeting program on sellersâ€™ behavioral responses. 

Prior to my PhD studies, I worked as a research analyst at the International Monetary Fund and an economic consulting company.
