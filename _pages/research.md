1. **Local Economic Effects of the Post-Cold War Procurement Drawdowns** <br/>
    *Working Paper* 
    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   :   Economic convergence has slowed across places. In the effort to identify factors causing regional disparities, a decline in manufacturing has been cited as a possible culprit. This paper looks through a new angle, a downsizing procurement, and examines the impacts on economic disparities across areas. With the end of the arms race between the USA and the Soviet Union, the US adopted a much more modest defense policy: the domestic defense procurement dropped by more than 40% over a decade. I estimate the causal effects of the drawdowns with an instrumental-variable approach by exploring different procurement types across geographies in the Cold War era. I find that defense drawdowns significantly affected the local labor market at the county level: reducing contracting worth $1,000 per capita in the most impacted defense industries decreases industrial employment by 0.3-0.4 percentage points directly. The other manufacturing sectors cannot entirely absorb the reduced employment in the flagship defense-related sectors. Estimates also show a net adverse spillover effect on the local non-tradable sector, with a magnitude of one-third of the direct impacts. In contrast to declining employment, few impacts were on the civilian wage and the number of establishments. Investigations on the exit options find that the local population responds to a lower labor demand through reduced in-migration but no evidence of increased out-migration. Evidence of workers' limited exit options suggests the need for remedy programs such as place-based policies to alleviate the disproportionate allocation of adverse labor market impacts. </details>




2. **The Impacts of International Students on Local Product Markets: Evidence from College Towns** <br/>
   *Working Paper*
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary> 
   In the recent 20 years, the total number of students from abroad at U.S. colleges and universities almost doubled, from 0.54 million in 2000 to 1.09 million in 2017. This paper evaluates the consumption impacts of the massive inflows of international students who pursue higher education in the United States. Focusing on cities with a non-negligible size of college students, the analysis exploits the variation of the international student enrollment, and estimates the causal effects on the selected non-traded industry. With an instrumental variable to control for confounding factors, the result supports the existence of the demand contribution and quantifies its magnitude: a 500 increase of international college students into a city with 50,000 baseline population brings about six more food and drinking places. The positive effects are concentrated in small-sized establishments. This paper adds to the impact analysis of international students through the lens of local product market.</details>
   



3. [Sharp Instrument: A Stab at Identifying the Causes of Economic Growth](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3221175), with Reda Cherif (IMF), Fuad Hasanov (IMF) <br/>
   *IMF Working Paper No. 18/117, available at [SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3221175)*
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary> 
   We shed new light on the determinants of growth by tackling the blunt and weak instrument problems in the empirical growth literature. As an instrument for each endogenous variable, we propose average values of the same variable in neighboring countries. This method has the advantage of producing variable-specific and time-varying—namely, “sharp”—and strong instruments. We also introduce “bias norms” to test the sensitivity of the estimates to the potential invalidity of our instruments. The estimations show that export sophistication is a relatively robust determinant of growth compared to other standard growth determinants such as human capital, trade, financial development, and institutions. Other growth determinants may be important to the extent they help improve export sophistication.</details>   



4. **Cheaper Drugs but Higher Bills?**, with Jiafeng Wu (UVA) <br/>
   *Work in Progress*
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary> 
   Hospitals in China were allowed to dispense medications with a markup profit of up to 15% of the wholesale price, creating financial incentives for drug over-prescription. To prevent over-prescriptions and reduce medicine expenditures, the central government initiated a rolled-out zero-markup policy (ZMP) for all medical facilities across the country. We explored a unique administrative healthcare claim dataset that covers all visitors to three tier-1 (class 3) public hospitals. To analyze how physicians change their behaviors, we use a difference-in-differences strategy to study the average changes in an individual’s spending in various categories resulting from a plausibly exogenous government-initiated ZMP reform. We detect the existence of over-utilization of medical services after the ZMP reform. In particular, we find that visitors in the comprehensive hospital purchase more medical consumables, whereas the patients in a traditional Chinese medicine hospital spend more on Chinese treatment materials. We find that the increase in these non-drug spending compensates for the drug expenditure so that the average medical bill is barely reduced. More strikingly, the data shows suggestive transfers of financial burdens across disease groups. Even though patients in some disease groups do not experience much decline in their medicine spending, their service expenditures rise after the reform, rendering a higher medical bill on average. These findings imply that without a change in compensation structure, physicians can pass on the lost revenue to patients through multiple channels, and patients might end up paying same or even higher bills.  </details>
